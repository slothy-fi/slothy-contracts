# Slothyfi Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts for the Slothyfi protocol.

## Building your own block

Anyone can add their custom block to Slothyfi. To do so, you need to create a new contract that inherits from the `BaseSlothyBlock` contract.  
You can find an example of a blocks in the `blocks/` directory.
